# Forms

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the creation and structuring of forms using **semantic HTML**. The main focus is on building well-organized, accessible, and user-friendly forms that follow best practices for modern web development.

## Purpose of the Repository
The repository is intended to:
- Showcase the use of semantic HTML elements in form design.
- Provide a clean and organized example for developers learning form creation.
- Highlight the use of `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and other semantic tags to improve accessibility and structure.

## Purpose of the Form
The form in this project is designed to collect structured user information in a clear and logical flow.  
Each section serves a specific purpose, making it easier for users to provide accurate and complete details.

### Form Sections
1. **Personal Information**  
   - Name, email, phone number, etc.
2. **Preferences/Selections**  
   - Options or choices depending on the form context.
3. **Additional Details**  
   - Text areas, comments, or custom input fields.
4. **Confirmation & Submission**  
   - Submit button and optional agreement/consent checkboxes.

## Implementation Approach
- **Semantic HTML** was used throughout the form to ensure better accessibility and SEO.
- The form is divided into logical sections using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>`.
- Labels are explicitly associated with their inputs using the `for` attribute for better screen reader support.
- Proper input types (`email`, `number`, `text`, etc.) are used to improve user experience.
- The structure was designed to be easily extendable for future styling with CSS or functionality with JavaScript.
